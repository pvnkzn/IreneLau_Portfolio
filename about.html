        <h1>About Me</h1>
            <div class = "projects">
                <p>My first experiences with designing stemmed from graphic design and media arts, where my younger self played around with fonts, colours, and layouts to create collages of my favourite characters.  I was inspired by others who posted amazing video edits on Instagram, motivating me to self-learn After Effects, in hopes of creating similar content.  Being a creator was a very enjoyable process and I had a fun time collaborating with others around my age with the same interests as me.  I found myself excited whenever I was able to apply these skills at school, whether it was editing my elementary school graduation video or crafting aesthetic pleasing presentations.

                <p>Now, as a 3rd year design student enrolled in SFU's SIAT, I draw upon my background and employ empathy to design interactions that resonate with users' specific needs.  I have experience with designing mobile apps and desktop websites, and I'm constantly looking for opportunities to expand my skillset and grow as a designer.</p>
                    
                <p>In my spare time, you can catch me reading speculative fiction, curating <a class = "in-text-link" href = "https://open.spotify.com/playlist/53nVZcbMKJAGqotCA5DziF?si=2c4ca91edb36472d">music playlists ðŸ¡¥</a> for every mood, watching the latest film releases, and binge-watching drama television series.</p>
