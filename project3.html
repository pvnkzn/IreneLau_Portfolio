                <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                <p>This was a semester-long team project completed for an interaction design methods course at SFU, covering the full design process from ideation to final solution. Our task was to choose an interesting context and audience to research and design a solution to enhance their experience. Initially, we considered three potential ideas and converged on streamlining the process of learning to drive and obtaining a license for primarily immigrant and non-local student drivers.</p>

                    <img src="img/secondary-research.png" alt="Screenshots of the secondary research conducted.">
                </div>

                <p>The first two weeks consisted of conducting secondary research. With my team, I gathered information about knowledge and road tests, the graduated licensing program, and common user goals and activities. This involved exploring ICBC's website, app, and resources provided for new drivers. We organized key information using Figjam.</p>

                </div>

                <p>For the next three weeks, we planned a field research study and analyzed our findings. We conducted interviews at an ICBC licensing office. We interviewed four participants to understand the availability of resources, barriers posed by cultural differences and driving norms, and support systems drivers rely on. I took upon the role of notetaker and recorded key points on-site. Afterwards, I performed a thematic analysis that will inform our solution.</p>

                    <img src="img/poster.png" alt="Pitch poster of a potential solution.">
                </div>

                <p>To explore potential solutions, we created pitch posters. I focused on a mobile app solution that would offer personalized learning to help drivers practice certain skills and build confidence.</p>

                <div class = "project-img">
                    <img src="img/storyboard.png" alt="Storyboard of a user booking driving lesson.">
                </div>

                <p>We refined two pitches and developed concept posters and storyboards for each. I crafted a storyboard that visualized the experience of an immigrant driver facing language barriers when booking lessons, and how a service finder would intervene in this process.</p>

            <section id="solution-3">
                <h2>Solution & Mockups</h2>

                <p>We focused the remainder of our time on our solution, which consists of both a student and an instructor interface. My role was to design and prototype the student interface. The features include pre-lesson practice, lesson booking, a feedback system, personal insights, and journaling.</p>

                <div class = "project-img">
                    <img src="img/solution-practice-and-booking.png" alt="Mockup of practice and lesson booking pages.">
                </div>

                <p>On the practice page, students can access modules added by their instructor that align with the upcoming driving lesson. Each module includes a progress indicator to track completion and features a brief quiz to reinforce key concepts and prepare students for topics that will be covered during the driving lesson. This feature aims to educate and prepare students, reduce anxiety, and build confidence. Moreover, students can efficiently book lessons with the instructor and view all past and upcoming lessons on this page.</p>

                <div class = "project-img">
                    <img src="img/solution-feedback-system.png" alt="Mockup of feedback system pages.">
                </div>

                <p>Students can access instructor feedback for each driving lesson through the home and practice pages. The feedback system includes star ratings for skills covered during the lesson and audio recordings of the instructor's more detailed comments, with transcripts for accessibility. This feature helps students identify their strengths and areas for improvement. Additionally, students can respond directly to the instructor's feedback, enabling clear and effective communication.</p>

                <div class = "project-img">
                    <img src="img/solution-insights-and-journal.png" alt="Mockup of home page with insights and journal entry pages.">
                </div>

                <p>The home page features quick actions and provides statistics and insights into the student's progress, allowing them to understand their driving skills at a glance. I prioritized consistent visuals and a hierarchal display of information. Additionally, the journaling feature encourages students to reflect on their driving lessons, with guided prompts that help them write meaningful entries. This aims to reinforce their learning and help them track their personal growth.</p>

                <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>

                <p>Through this project, I learned that to narrow down to one solution, I should continuously look back on my research and consider which would align best with the needs of the target audience. For instance, a challenge that arose during our pitches was that the scope seemed too narrow, and feedback from the instructor suggested they resembled features of a larger app. Together, we referred back to our research and organized potential features using a prioritization matrix. This helped us better understand how they could work cohesively. We found that a comprehensive app offering features for connecting with instructors, a personalized learning plan, and a way to get feedback would help student drivers efficiently track their progress. This process strengthened my problem-solving skills and taught me how to address challenges collaboratively to move forward with a clear idea to implement.</p>
