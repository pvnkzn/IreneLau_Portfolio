            <h2>Hi, I'm Irene,</h2>
            <p>a fourth-year student at SFU's School of Interactive Arts and Technology and an aspiring UX designer. My dedication to creating inclusive and accessible designs stems from observing my immigrant parents' struggles when using technology. I prioritize simplicity and minimalism with a strong art direction. Being curious about how people interact with technology, objects, and experiences in their daily lives drives me to create thoroughly researched user-centred solutions that account for diverse needs. I am passionate about applying my skills in Figma, Adobe CC, HTML, and CSS to craft intuitive, purposeful, and visually appealing designs that resonate with audiences :&rpar;</p>
