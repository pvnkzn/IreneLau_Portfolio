                <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                <p><a class = "in-text-link" href = "https://uxwashere.com/">UX Was Here ü°•</a> is an inclusive platform for individuals of all experience levels who are passionate about UX to connect and learn. However, the main problem they face is the high turnover and low usage rate. Therefore, our project set out to tackle this issue by leveraging existing platform features, such as the explore and event discovery pages, with the goal of fostering long-term engagement and active participation.  This project was submitted for the <a class = "in-text-link" href = "https://eunoiadesign.ca/">2024 Eunoia UX Design Jam ü°•</a>.</p>

            <section id="client-goals">
                <h2>Client Goals</h2>
                <p>Firstly, our team worked together to define the goals of the client. We found that UX Was Here wants to understand the motivations that drive users to engage with the community on the platform. They would like to retain existing users by creating a sense of belonging and by identifying barriers that prevent them from becoming active members.</p>
            </section>

            <section id = existing-features>
                <h2>Existing Features</h2>
                <div class = "project-img">
                    <img src="img/ux-was-here-events.png" alt="UX Was Here's Events page, displaying a few events, their dates, and option to share or view more info.">
                </div>

                <p>Upon reviewing the website's different pages, we found that UX Was Here already has some pretty great features catering to the diverse needs of their users, such as the explore, events, and jobs pages. We noticed an upcoming messaging feature, which was a potential area for us to explore. Although these features serve the intended purposes UX Was Here well, we identified a need for sustained interaction beyond the initial engagement.  With my team, I brainstormed ways to enhance these features or introduce additional elements to provide users with a reason to return to the site.</p>

            <section id="competitor-analysis">
                <h2>Competitor Analysis</h2>

                <div class = "project-img">
                    <img src="img/competitors-2.png" alt="IterateUX's website home page for their design challenge event.">

                </div>

                <p>I explored similar UX communities such as Design Buddies, Iterate UX, and ADPList, and discovered that each of these sites had some unique features that set them apart from the crowd, which UX Was Here must establish. For instance, ADPList offers a mentorship system where users can book sessions and get support from industry professionals on various topics.</p>

            <section id="audience-problem">
                <h2>Target Audience & Problem Statement</h2>
                <p>During the opening ceremony of the Eunoia UX Design Jam, an intriguing topic that is often overlooked was brought up: tips for networking as an introvert.  This inspired our group to focus on introverted individuals as our target audience, since UX Was Here must be inclusive of everyone.  This led to our problem statement:</p>

                <p>How might we enable introverted users to network and establish real-life connections effectively before an event?</p>
            </section>

            <section id="survey">
                <h2>Conducting a Survey</h2>

                    <img src="img/survey.png" alt="ADPList's mentors page, showcasing the ability to connect with mentors in various fields.">
                </div>

                <p>We decided to survey 34 diverse UX designers with varying experience levels to gather a sense of their needs and feelings when networking and participating in UX-related events. We found that many felt uncomfortable due to impostor syndrome, a fear of being rejected, and a lack of confidence in their design skills. Through discussion, we felt it was necessary to implement features that allow users to connect beforehand.</p>

            <section id="wireframes">
                <h2>Sketches & Wireframes</h2>

                <div class = "project-img">
                    <img src="img/sketches-wireframes-1.png" alt="Initial wireframes for our design, showcasing the events and messaging page.">
                </div>

                <div class = "project-img">
                    <img src="img/sketches-wireframes-2.png" alt="Initial wireframes for our design, showcasing the events and messaging page.">
                </div>

                <p>I created some rough initial sketches and wireframes to envision a mobile format for the events and messaging pages. This gave me insights into the layout and type of content that would need to be included and ensured that all elements were connected seamlessly and the design made sense at every step of the user flow.</p>
            </section>

            <section id="solution">
                <h2>Solution & Mockups</h2>

                    <img src="img/solution-attendees.png" alt="Mockups for events page, showing a list of attendees.">
                </div>

                <p>Our team decided to challenge ourselves by prototyping a mobile app version of the site, with a main focus on enhancing the events page. In the event details, we added a list of attendees. This feature provides users who are thinking of attending an event with insights into its diversity, and the individuals who will be present.</p>

                <div class = "project-img">
                    <img src="img/solution-group-chat.png" alt="Mockups for group chats page, showing recommended group chats and the messaging feature.">
                </div>

                <p>Another key feature on this page is the addition of an event group chat, providing users with the opportunity to get to know other attendees early on, and empowering introverts to take the first step in connecting with others.</p>

                <div class = "project-img">
                    <img src="img/solution-design-sprint.png" alt="Mockups for design sprint events page, showing the ability for individuals to connect and collaborate in a team based on their experience level and skills.">
                </div>

                <p>By including online ‚Äúdesign sprint‚Äù events, users can collaborate on design activities in a low-stakes environment. They are matched with others with similar experience levels, ensuring everyone feels included.</p>

                <div class = "project-img">
                    <img src="img/solution-explore.png" alt="Mockups for explore page, showing the different sections, and the people you may know page.">
                </div>

                <p>Lastly, we revamped the explore page to make it more accessible. It now offers personalized recommendations, suggesting users to follow and group chats to join.</p>

                <p>We used UX Was Here's existing style guide and the few mobile mockups provided as reference points for integrating elements into our design. I made sure to maintain consistency by adopting a similar layout and implementing logical colour schemes and button placements, while preserving the platform's minimalist aesthetic. Rather than the traditional hamburger menu, I incorporated a bottom navigation bar that emphasized the key features for enhanced efficiency and accessibility.</p>

                <p>The implemented features effectively address our problem statement and align closely with the goals of UX Was Here. Introverts can utilize these new features to their advantage to meet new people and expand their networks. Moreover, users can practice their design skills by collaborating with others on the platform, thereby promoting active participation and engagement.</p>

                <h2>Prototype</h2>

                <div class = "project-img">

                </div>

                <p>As shown in the prototype, in terms of interaction patterns, users can scroll to explore content on the pages and tap for more details.  Horizontal scrolls were used for sections such as the "attendees list" and "people you may know", complemented by a "see all" button to present information in a collapsed format, reducing cognitive overload.</p>

                </div>

                <p>Apart from the main features, we also designed a new logo for UX Was Here by experimenting with typography and integrating the iconic Kilroy Was Here doodle into it.</p>

                <div class = "project-img">
                    <img src="img/bonus-features.png" alt="ADPList's mentors page, showcasing the ability to connect with mentors in various fields.">
                </div>

                <p>Also, we designed a mobile version of the sign up page to ensure an efficient and user-friendly onboarding process.</p>
            </section>

            <section id="lessons">
                <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
                <p>From this project, I learned that it is extremely important to establish our problem statement and target audience near the beginning of the process.  A challenge our team faced is that we were too eager to jump into possible solutions, resulting in many that did not address a clear problem or a defined goal.  Feedback from the judges of the design jam reinforced the importance of utilizing a more structured approach to problem-solving, and ensuring the framing aligns with user needs and business goals.  I learned that beyond the design itself, it is crucial to present our work effectively, and we needed to be more clear and detailed in aspects such as the research methodology and survey implementation.</p>

                <p>Reflecting on our challenges and feedback provided, I recognize the value of taking a step back and referring to our objectives before diving into new ideas.  It is also necessary to establish a way to document our process early on to guarantee we have all the required content to craft a concise presentation, avoiding ambiguity.  I will carry these lessons into my future projects, using them to refine my approach towards problem-solving and presentations.</p>
