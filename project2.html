                <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                <p>This project was completed as part of an interface design course at SFU.  Over the course of 3 weeks, we were tasked to design a new feature for an existing mobile app.  This involved researching the app's purpose, current features, and user interactions.  My chosen app was Goodreads, which is a social platform and database for readers to discover books, track their reading progress, view community reviews, and generate discussion.  With a focus on the goals of users, I created a reading insights feature that helps them visualize reading preferences and statistics over specific timeframes.</p>

                </div>

                <p>During the first week, I conducted an analysis of the Goodreads app by using it myself.  I explored the user flows of two key features of the app, which were bookshelves and reviews.  This provided me with insights into Goodreads' intended users, along with the motivations and frustrations they may face.  Moreover, it helped me become familar with the interface design elements and interaction patterns, such as the layout, taps, scrolls, and steps involved in completing a task.  This process helped me identify potential areas within the app where a new feature could enhance its existing functionalities.</p>

                <h2>Feature Proposal & Wireframes</h2>

                </div>

                <p>The next week consisted of proposing two potential features based on my research findings.  I created personas to present different scenarios in which users may engage with the app.  By revisiting the platform and consulting with other users around me, I found that a main frustration revolved around the difficulties in managing large bookshelves due to a poor sorting system.</p>
                
                <p>Therefore, I proposed the implementation of a bookshelves filter system.  This would allow users to filter bookshelves according to the criteria specified, such as genre and author, catering to their changing interests.  It would be especially relevant for large bookshelves in which it is difficult to search for books without knowing the titles.  Filters enable recognition rather than recall to narrow down options meaningfully, preventing users from having to swipe down a long list, thus providing flexibility and efficiency of use.</p>

                </div>

                <div class = "project-img">
                    <img src="img/insights-wireframes-1.png" alt="Sketched wireframes for insights feature.">
                </div>

                <div class = "project-img">
                    <img src="img/insights-wireframes-2.png" alt="Sketched wireframes for insights feature.">
                </div>

                <p>The second feature I proposed was reading insights.  While using the app, Goodreads prompted me to join the 2024 reading challenge.  By exploring this page, I found that it allows users to set a goal for the number of books they aim to read in the current year. However, I noticed a lack of detailed information to motivate users to achieve their goal. Additionally, the app does not provide ways for users to understand their current and past reading habits beyond simply indicating whether they are ahead or behind schedule in the reading challenge.</p>
                    
                <p>The proposed reading insights feature complements the reading challenge by offering statistics on books and pages read, top authors, and top genres. It aids users in understanding their reading preferences and can be used for progress tracking and goal setting, providing motivation.  Presenting information visually allows for greater hierarchy and supports minimalist design by displaying only the essential aspects. Moreover, users can flexibly view stats for any timeframe, and the layout and interaction patterns are similar to the discover page, demonstrating internal consistency.</p>

                </div>

                <p>By referring back to the user goals and considering feedback from my TA, I decided to proceed with the reading insights feature as it provided me with a larger scope to work with.  Also, competitor apps such as StoryGraph offer a similar annual reading goal feature, but it provides detailed statistics.  This served as a challenge and opportunity for me to present information in a manner that aligns with Goodreads' purpose.</p>

                <p>During the final week, I designed mockups and a prototype for the reading insights feature, with Nielsen's usability heuristics in mind.  A key component of this feature were timeframes that enabled users to toggle between preset options or select specific dates from the calendar for insights.  Moreover, I implemented a grid view to allow users to view books and authors more efficiently, particularly beneficial for larger timeframes.</p>

                <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>

                <p>This project was my first experience with designing for a mobile app independently.  I learend the importance of conducting thorough research on both the app and its users.  Through repeated use of the app, I was able to discover more areas for a new feature integration.  Thus, I learned the importance of iterative design and moving beyond surface-level understanding and assumptions.  Moreover, I found that analyzing existing interface patterns early on streamlined the design process, which helped me maintain consistency and facilitate better integration of my feature into the app, rather than trying to reinvent layouts and elements.  From the feedback I received, I realized that I could have explored more visualization methods, specifically for the top genres.  Moving forward, I aim to dedicate more time to exploring diverse approaches before narrowing down on one solution.</p>
